# graph
it can find a nearst way between to node of a graph


for example you can go to node 2, 4 from node 1

1: [2, 4]


it's a graph

g = {1: [2, 4], 2: [1, 3, 5], 3: [2, 6], 4: [1, 5, 7], 5: [4, 8, 2, 6], 6: [3], 7: [4, 8], 8: [5, 9, 7], 9: [8, 6]}


be careful you can go to node 2 from node 1 and you can go to node 1 from node 2

1: [2, 4], 2: [1, 3, 5]
